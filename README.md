# Basic A/B Testing
A high level introduction to applying pandas to analyzing A/B testing result. In this example, we will look at the result of a simple A/B testing experiment, where users were divided into two groups - treatment and control group. The treatment group received a personalized email about a campaign, while the control group received a normal email with no personalization. Our target metric is the conversion rate, ie. we will investigate whethere the treatment group has a higher conversion rate.

This exercise will comprise of the following:

1. User allocation: inspect the number of users being allocated to treatment group and vice versa
2. Lift and statistical significance: evaluate the result of the A/B test using two key measurements, lift and statistical significance
3. Segmentation: understand the result of the A/B test in the context of user segmentation

This repository is inspired by DataCamp's Analyzing Marketing Campaigns with pandas Case Study, and I highly recommend that you check this course out as it covers a much broader scope :)
